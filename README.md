# Redline
Progressive reverse and investigation of AMX by Harman RPM packages.

## Foreword
Please understand this is done from a perspective of enlightenment. If any material hosted here is believed to be unlawful please point out the exact offending files privately and I will see to their removal as soon as humanly possible.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyse both the hardware and software of an AMX Master Control device and the RPM platform.
The intention is to learn more about what exactly makes up one of these IOT boxes and how all the pieces come together to make the whole.
It is also to stretch the boundaries of the RPM platform and learn more about it's seemingly secretive inner workings.
It will contain information, tools and code as well as documentation.
